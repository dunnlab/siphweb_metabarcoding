#Reviewer 1

Tone down the specialization narrative when our data is purely qualitative
Respond by explaining that quantitative statistical analysis in not in the scope of this paper, and it is not meaningful given the nature of the data, and the feasibility of sample replication in the deep-sea
Describe the protocol in more detail in the methods
Describe the primer design analyses
Change Damian-Serrano 2020 citations to protocols.io DOI link
Identify which V1-9 regions the priming sites correspond to.
Double check with pre-existing primers for these regions see if they match.
Rename the barcodes to reflect their gene position.
Evaluate assignment differences between SILVA databases and report results
HOW? - play around to see if any comparison makes sense
Argument that comparison was not in the scope, that these were integrated to interpret the result based on taxonomic rank coverage and different sensitivities.
Redo all SM figures (other than SM10 and SM11) as summary tables.

#Reviewers 2

Correct the claim of application to other gelatinous species including those two articles
Clarify which sources were interpreted as environmental and why. (number of reads, natural history)
“Eukaryote”, “Bacteria”, “Hydrozoan”, “Rotifer”, “Shark”, “Ascidian”, “Sponge”, “Hydromedusa” “Bryozoan”, “Echinoderm”, “Gastrotrich” “Orthonectid” “Bivalve”, “Anemone”, “Echiurid”, “Hydroid”
Clarify why marine snow was not considered
Specify the species-level identification confidence for the copepod genus/species mentioned in the Atlantic specimens (Centropages sp. 54.99%, Acartia tonsa 91.5%, and Temora discaudata 91.81% using the SILVA123 database).
Clarify that we used gastrozooids from all specimens not just ones with visible gut contents.
Clarify that gastrozooids without visible gut contents were also sampled, we just made sure that the bulgy ones were definitely sampled.
Explain DAPC first usage
Synthesize discussion
Catalog voucher specimens. Provide voucher catalog numbers through YPM.
Specify Geneious version used (11.1.5)
Clarify in Fig 5 caption what “gelatinous” encompasses
